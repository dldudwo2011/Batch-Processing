# Batch-Processing
Jakarta EE 9 - Batch Processing

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Create a batch job with a batchlet step to download a CSV file

- Create a batch job with a chunk step to extract data from a CSV file, transform a CSV line to a Java entity object, aand load a Java entity object to a database.

- Use a Geospatial database function to determine the distance between two points
